/* Hash Tables Implementation.
 *
 * This file implements in memory hash tables with insert/del/replace/find/
 * get-random-element operations. Hash tables will auto resize if needed
 * tables of power of two in size are used, collisions are handled by
 * chaining. See the source code for more information... :)
